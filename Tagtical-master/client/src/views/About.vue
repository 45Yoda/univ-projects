      These days technology can be found in everything in our life, from medicine to education. 
      Sports aren't an exception and everyday there are more cases of technology incorporated in sports,
      such as: goal line technology used in various sports and more recently the introduction of VAR in football.
      This technology isn't only directed at the games there has also been an evolution in the way that coaches train their players. The 
      gathering and analysis of game data can be very useful for a coach to get a better ideia of a player's capabilities and help maximize
      his potential.
      It's here that Tagtical Hockey tries to make a difference. We want to gather the data of the players in a single game and show it 
      in a way that a coach can improve his knowledge about his team players and also improve performance.

      This type of technology is already being used in some outdoors sports but we challenge ourselves to bring this to indoor sports too.
